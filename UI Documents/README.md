# Design Documents for GuitarApp

## Overview
The GuitarApp Front-End documents were created with Figma. In the Version 0.0.1 Components folder, you will find all the components that you create in the react frontend. These mockups will give you a quick overview of how each component will look. 

## Design Resources
Each component was designed with modularity in mind and all future designers should keep that in mind when desiging these apps.
